# Go by Example — Practice Repo

This repository is my personal practice space for learning Go (Golang) using the excellent Go by Example site as a reference: https://gobyexample.com/

Each `.go` file is a small, focused example that mirrors a topic from Go by Example. I read a page, write the code myself, and run it locally to reinforce the concepts.

## What’s here
- `hello-world.go` — first program and basic printing
- `variables.go` — declaring and using variables
- `values.go` — working with basic values and types
- `constant.go` — constants and iota
- `for.go` — looping with `for`
- `if-else.go` — conditional logic with if/else
- `switch.go` — branching with `switch`
- `arrays.go` — arrays and indexing

I’ll keep adding more examples as I go through the topics.

## How to run an example
Make sure you have Go installed (Go 1.20+ is fine). Then run any file directly, for example:

```powershell
# From the project root
go run .\hello-world.go

# Try other samples
go run .\variables.go
go run .\values.go
go run .\constant.go
go run .\for.go
go run .\if-else.go
go run .\switch.go
go run .\arrays.go
```

Tip: You can check your Go version with:
```powershell
go version
```

## Why I’m doing this
- Build a strong foundation in core Go syntax and patterns
- Practice writing small, clear programs
- Learn by doing (read → code → run → tweak)
